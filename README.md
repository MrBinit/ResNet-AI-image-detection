# AI Image Detection Model

## Overview

We have developed an advanced AI model using the Swin Transformer architecture, capable of detecting whether an image is AI-generated or not. This project leverages a high-quality dataset from Kaggle and a pretrained model from Hugging Face, which we fine-tuned on our dataset to enhance prediction accuracy.

## Features

- **State-of-the-Art Architecture**: Utilizes the Swin Transformer, known for its efficiency and performance in image recognition tasks.
- **Pretrained Model**: Incorporates a pretrained model from Hugging Face to jumpstart the training process and improve overall model accuracy.
- **High-Quality Dataset**: Uses a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle, providing a diverse set of images for robust training.
- **Fine-Tuning**: The pretrained model was fine-tuned on our specific dataset, ensuring that the model is tailored to the task of detecting AI-generated images.
